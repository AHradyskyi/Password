# Password
This code was created as an exrercise in the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.

According to the "rules" if you want to create a "strong password" you should type 8 symbols at least. You shoud use letters, capitalize letters and digits.
In case you did not pass this rule, the program will remind you the correct input. It will run until you input the "good one".

"Emergency exit" will be created later.
